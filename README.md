# CRBC-and-CRVC
Breif workflows and code for crop root bacterial and viral genome collection construction and analysis

## Workflow of CRBC
1. [CRBC genome construction](CRBC_workflow/CRBC_genome_construction)
2. Bacterial genome taxonomic classfication
3. Define novel bacterial species
4. Bacterial gene prediction and functional annotation
5. Identifiy novel BGCs
6. Calculate bacterial abundance, prevalence and growth rate.

## Workflow of CRVC
1. CRVC genome construction
2. Viral genome taxonomic classification
3. Define novel viral species and genera
4. Viral gene prediction and functional annotation
5. Viral lifestyle prediction
6. Host prediction
